# raycasting-motor
Hello everyone, here's my raycasting engine under python, it includes the basic operation of the motor and I've also added texture display during 3D rendering. 
To make this raycasting work you first need to install pygame (pip install pygame) and then select the textures you're going to use, to do this you need to go to the 'object_renderer' module and change the path of the images used at the bottom of the code, you can add images as you like and remember to change the walls you want in the 'map' module.
I'm currently working with some friends to use this engine to create a random labyrinth-solving game, which I'll publish once it's finished.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank the Coder Space tutorial, which was a great help in my project.
